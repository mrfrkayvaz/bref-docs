# Data Types

> [!TIP]
>
> Since Bref **supports JSON by default**, its data types are exactly the same as JSON.

You can use the following **6 fundamental JSON data types** in your Bref files.

### 1. String

Represents text values. Written inside double quotes (`"..."`).  
Supports escape characters (`\\"`, `\\n`, `\\t`, etc.).

```json
{ "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody" }
```

### 2. Number

Represents integers or floating-point numbers.  
The decimal separator is a dot (`.`).  
Special values like `NaN` or `Infinity` are **not** supported.

```json
{ "streams": 1980000000, "duration": 5.55 }
```

### 3. Boolean

Represents logical values: `true` or `false`.

```json
{ "is_favorite": true }
```

### 4. Null

Represents a missing or unknown value.  
It is **not** a string (`"null"` is different).

```json
{ "album": null }
```

### 5. Object

Represents a collection of key–value pairs.  
Defined with curly braces `{}`.

```json
{
  "title": "Bohemian Rhapsody",
  "duration": "5:55"
}
```

> [!TIP]

> In Bref, when you use type definitions for objects, you don’t need to include the keys explicitly — only the values in the defined order.

```json
:song { title, duration }

{
  "Bohemian Rhapsody", "5:55"
}: song
```

### 6. Array

Represents an ordered list of values.  
Defined with square brackets `[]`.  
The values can be of different data types.

```json
[ "Rock", "Pop", "Jazz" ]
```
